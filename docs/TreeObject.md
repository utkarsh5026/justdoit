# Git Tree Objects: Comprehensive Documentation

## 1. Introduction

Git tree objects are fundamental components of Git's object model. They represent the structure of a directory in a Git repository, forming a snapshot of the repository's file system at a specific point in time.

## 2. Structure of a Git Tree Object

A Git tree object is essentially a list of entries, where each entry represents either a file (blob) or another directory (tree). Each entry in a tree object contains:

1. **Mode**: A 6-digit octal number representing the file type and permissions.
2. **Path**: The name of the file or directory.
3. **SHA-1**: A 20-byte SHA-1 hash pointing to the blob or tree object that this entry represents.

### 2.1 Mode

The mode is a 6-digit octal number that represents both the type of the entry and its permissions. Common modes are:

- `100644`: Regular file
- `100755`: Executable file
- `040000`: Directory (tree)
- `120000`: Symbolic link
- `160000`: Gitlink (submodule)

### 2.2 Path

The path is the name of the file or directory that this entry represents. It's stored as a null-terminated string in the tree object.

### 2.3 SHA-1

The SHA-1 is a 20-byte hash that points to the object (blob or tree) that this entry represents. It's stored in binary format.

## 3. Binary Format

In its binary form, a tree object is structured as follows:

```
[6-byte mode] [space] [null-terminated path] [20-byte SHA-1]
[6-byte mode] [space] [null-terminated path] [20-byte SHA-1]
...
```

This structure repeats for each entry in the tree.

## 4. Sorting

Entries in a tree object are sorted. The sorting rules are:

1. Entries with `'100644'`, `'100755'`, `'120000'` modes (blobs) come before entries with `'040000'` mode (tree).
2. Entries are then sorted by their name (path) in ascending order.

## 5. Operations on Tree Objects

### 5.1 Creating a Tree Object

To create a tree object:

1. Collect all the entries (files and directories) that should be in the tree.
2. Sort the entries according to the sorting rules.
3. Serialize each entry in the format: `[mode] [space] [path] [null byte] [SHA-1]`.
4. Concatenate all serialized entries.
5. Calculate the SHA-1 of the resulting byte string.

### 5.2 Parsing a Tree Object

To parse a tree object:

1. Read the mode (6 bytes or until a space is encountered).
2. Skip the space.
3. Read the path until a null byte is encountered.
4. Read the next 20 bytes as the SHA-1.
5. Repeat from step 1 until the end of the object is reached.

### 5.3 Modifying a Tree Object

Tree objects are immutable in Git. To "modify" a tree:

1. Create a new tree object with the desired changes.
2. Calculate its new SHA-1.
3. Update the parent tree or commit to point to this new tree object.

## 6. Relationship with Other Git Objects

- **Commits**: A commit object points to a tree object that represents the root directory of the repository at the time of that commit.
- **Blobs**: Tree entries with file modes point to blob objects, which contain the actual file content.
- **Other Trees**: Tree entries with directory modes point to other tree objects, forming a hierarchical structure.

## 7. Use in Git Operations

Tree objects are used in various Git operations:

- **Checkout**: Git uses tree objects to recreate the working directory.
- **Diff**: Git compares tree objects to determine what has changed between commits.
- **Merge**: When merging branches, Git combines different tree objects.

## 8. Performance Considerations

- Tree objects allow Git to efficiently store and retrieve directory structures.
- By using SHA-1 hashes, Git can quickly determine if two trees are identical.
- The hierarchical nature of trees allows Git to efficiently track changes in large repositories.

## 9. Conclusion

Git tree objects are a crucial part of Git's object model, allowing it to efficiently represent and manipulate directory structures. Understanding tree objects is key to comprehending how Git internally manages and versions your files and directories.
